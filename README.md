## Wiring:

Wiring is desctribed on the [PxMatrix library](https://github.com/2dom/PxMatrix) pretty well, but to try make it a little easier I have created wiring diagrams for the different types of boards.

To connect your power supply up to the panel, you can connect the display power wire directly to a DC jack screw terminal breakout or use some larger screw terminals and some perfboard
